## Project Objectives
This project aims to:

- Identify trends in profitability, market value, sales, and assets.
- Examine the global distribution of top-performing companies.

### About the Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Forbes' annual ranking of the top 2000 companies worldwide. It contains approximately **16,000 rows**, with **2000 companies ranked each year** from 2017 to 2024. Many companies appear multiple times, as they are ranked annually based on financial performance. The dataset includes metrics such as market value, sales, profits, assets, and regional distribution.

## Data Cleaning in Python
Data preprocessing was performed to handle inconsistencies and ensure accuracy. This included:
- Removing special characters from column names and values.
- Stripping whitespace.
- Converting numerical columns to the correct data types.
